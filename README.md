# To review or not to review? That's the question

__Does the amount of reviews that your listing is getting on AirBnB affect the actual review score? Does this effect differ between big or small cities in Spain?__

## Motivation

We all know the feeling of opening an e-mail that asks you to leave a review on a product that you just bought or a listing that you stayed the night at. But do more reviews lead to a higher review score? Furthermore, this effect is examined at cities in Spain that differ in sizes, such as Malage compared to the capital Madrid. This code is written in order to find answers to these questions.
