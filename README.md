# Short project title

__Long project title, e.g., research question__

## Motivation

Motivate your research question or business problem. Clearly explain which problem is solved.

## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## Repository overview

Provide an overview of the directory structure and files.

## Running instructions

Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## More resources

Point interested users to any related literature and/or documentation.

## About

This project is performed by project group 2 of the [Data Preparation and Workflow Management course](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep) of the TISEM department of Tilburg University. 
The project is done in the fall 2021 version of the course. The project was part of a team project performed by Marketing Analytics master students. Professor [Hannes Datta](https://github.com/hannesdatta) contributed by providing helpful feedback during project feedback meetings.

# Example of reproducible research workflow 

This is a basic example repository using Gnu make for a reproducible research workflow, as described in detail here: [tilburgsciencehub.com](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/). 

The main aim of this to have a basic structure, which can be easily adjusted to use in an actual project.  In this example project, the following is done: 
1. Download and prepare data
2. Run some analysis
3. Present results in a final pdf generated using LaTeX

## Dependencies
- R 
- R packages: 
	install.packages("stargazer")
- Gnu make 
- TeX distribution (I use TeX Live 2019) 
- For the `makefile` to work, R, Gnu make and the TeX distribution (specifically `pdflatex`) need to be made available in the system path 
- Detailed installation instructions can be found here: [tilburgsciencehub.com](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/)


## Notes
- `make clean` removes all unncessary temporary files. 
- Tested under Linux Mint (should work in any linux distro, as well as on Windows and Mac) 
- IMPORTANT: In `makefile`, when using `\` to split code into multiple lines, no space should follow `\`. Otherwise Gnu make aborts with error 193. 
- Many possible improvements remain. Comments and contributions are welcome!
