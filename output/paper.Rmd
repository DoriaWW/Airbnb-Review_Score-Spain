# Introduction

# Motivation

We all know the feeling of opening an e-mail that asks you to leave a review on a product that you just bought or a listing that you stayed the night at. But do more reviews lead to a higher review score? Furthermore, this effect is examined at cities in Spain that differ in sizes, such as Malaga compared to the capital Madrid. This code is written in order to find answers to these questions.

The reason for diving into this problem is because review scores are an important factor for customers when they decide which listing to stay at. Hosts want a good review score and some push their guests to leave a review. The issue that arises is that more reviews does not necessarily result into a higher review score. This study is conducted in order to show hosts if they should or should not push their guests for reviews by analyzing the relationship between review score and number of reviews, while taking moderators and control variables into account.

The study focusses on seven different cities in Spain. To be able to examine the differences between small and big cities, there are three categories; Big, Medium or Small. The number of residents determine the category of the city:

A Big city has more than 1000000 (a million) residents
A Medium city has more than 500000 residents
A Small city has less than 500000 residents
The cities:

Big: Barcelona and Madrid

Medium: Sevilla, Valencia and Malaga

Small: Menorca and Girona


# Data

# Part I. Votes
## Data Collection


## Data Processing


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap= "Votes for Trump in 2020" , out.height= '160%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../output/Overview-Trump2020.jpg')
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap= "Votes for Trump in 2016" , out.height= '160%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../output/Overview-Trump2016.jpg')
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap= "Regression comparison table" , out.height= '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../output/compare_table.png')
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='right', fig.cap= "Regression comparison graph", out.height='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../output/regression comparison.jpg')
```



# Methodology

## Compare differences in difference (DiD)



# Results

**Votes**

* [Figure 1 & 2] The general take-away from this overview is the fact that Trump has lost about 1/6 of the votes from his previous (2016 election) top 5 supporter states. Which could indicate that people lost their faith in Trump from his 4 years political services and changed their believes. Although Trump also gained some new supports, especially from Indiana, California Washington, South Carolina and Missouri.
